# Potentiometer Controller

it's a mini project i made in school, using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) platform.
You can use [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/download/) as an alternative


## How it works 

Using the Arduino analog input function to control the brightness of the LED light by reading input voltage values through a potentiometer.

## Installation 

> Some Stupid Instructions that you might forget !
I recommend using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) Choose your version depending on your operation system and Download it 
 
1) Connect your arduino board
2) to verify the connection go to ```Tools > Port  You will see "COM4" in windows or "/dev/tty0/ACM0" in Linux```  
3) Choose Your Board go to ```Tools > Board and choose your board (Arduino UNO or Arduino Mini)```
4) if you wanna test your code and debug it go to ```Sketch > Verify/Compile``` if you wanna send it directly ```Sketch > Upload```

## Components
