# Alarm system

it's a mini project i made in school, using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) platform, 
You can use (Fritzing)[https://fritzing.org/download/] as an alternative

## How it works? 

it's basically using the ultrasonic sensor to detect an intrusion and it makes a sound on a certain Hertz value when an object comes too close.

## Installation 

> Some Stupid Instructions that you might forget !

- I recommend using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) Choose your version depending on your operation system and Download it 
1. Connect your arduino board
2. to verify the connection go to ```Tools > Port  You will see "COM4" in windows or "/dev/tty0/ACM0" in Linux```  
3. Choose Your Board go to ```Tools > Board and choose your board (Arduino UNO or Arduino Mini)```
4. if you wanna test your code and debug it go to ```Sketch > Verify/Compile``` if you wanna send it directly ```Sketch > Upload```

## Components 

`Arduino UNO or any other compatible board`
`Wires`
`Buzzer`
`Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04`
