### Configuration file

Algo requires an API key from your Scaleway account to create a server.
The API key is generated by going to your Scaleway credentials at [https://console.scaleway.com/project/credentials](https://console.scaleway.com/project/credentials), and then selecting "Generate new API key" on the right side of the box labeled "API Keys".
You'll be ask for to specify a purpose for your API key before it is created. You will then be presented and "Access key" and a "Secret key".

Enter the "Secret key" when Algo prompts you for the `auth token`. You won't need the "Access key".
This information will be pass as the `algo_scaleway_token` variable when asked for in the Algo prompt.

Your organization ID is also on this page: https://console.scaleway.com/account/credentials
