Noteworthy:
- the GUI uses 8443 instead of 445.
- SSH uses 8022 instead of 222.
- access to IPCop and to the internet from internal networks (aka
Green, Blue, Orange) is very much different. Spend some time with the
various options you will find under "Firewall Settings" and the online 
admin manual.
- Several translations are complete, other languages are work in progress.
- backups from 1.4-series can not be used.
- addons made for the 1.4-series will not work.
